### How it works

If we know, where .git folder is located on the remote server, but we can not just clone or checkout it,
 there's always a possibility to read all information from Git objects.
 
Git objects are stored in a special folder and each of them has an unique identifier,
which is simple SHA1 hash.

Each object contains some information, eg. current tree structure, file content or commit content.

Take a look at http://githowto.com/git_internals_working_directly_with_git_objects for reference.
